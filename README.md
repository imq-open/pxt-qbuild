# pxt-qbuild

This repository provides a BBC Micro:bit MakeCode extension for [Q:build](https://github.com/imq-open/qbuild). 
Q:build is a Micro:bit add-on board that converts a Micro:bit into a sensor (or *device*) 
that can be plugged into the Raspberry Pi Build HAT. 
Q:build is designed and tested specifically for the Build HAT, but *should* 
work with other hubs (controllers) as well. 

Q:build only supports Micro:bit V2.
